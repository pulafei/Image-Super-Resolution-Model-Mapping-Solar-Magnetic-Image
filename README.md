# Image-Super-Resolution-Model-Mapping-Solar-Magnetic-Image
## Abstract
With the change in technology, the accuracy of detectors has gradually improved. Inevitably, the data detected by the old detector would not be as clear as the data detected by the new detector. The photospheric line-of-sight magnetic field maps integrated from Michelson Doppler Imager (MDI) and Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) detection data have the same problem. This project builds an image super-resolution model to fit the old magnetic field maps related to MDI, which is the old detector, to the new magnetic field maps related to HMI, which is the new detector. This project will be a reference for doing the same type of data clarity enhancement in the future.
